# Cross_Zero_Game-Python-code
Cross Zero Game in Python  The interesting Python project will be build using the pygame library.  We will be explaining all the pygame object methods that are used in this project.  Pygame is a great library that will allow us to create the window and draw images and shapes on the window.  This way we will capture mouse coordinates and identify the block where we need to mark ‘X’ or ‘O’.  Then we will check if the user wins the game or not.
